# GMGL
## GLFW wrapper for Gamemaker Studio 2

---

### Reasons to actually check this out
* Learn OpenGL in a simple environment.
* Use any version of OpenGL.
* Write your own renderer in GML.
* Want more than just vertex and fragment shaders.
* Want to define your own attributes for shaders.
* Basically if you want complete control of your shaders.
* There are probably reasons I'm not thinking of because 
I don't know much about OpenGL or 3D really in general.

### Reasons to go away and not use this
* For starters, it is very much a WIP. I highly recommend you don't use 
  this for any serious projects yet.
* Not sure if it's just me but it feels a bit choppy.
* You're using a different window than the actual GM window which 
  is only hidden when you disable the draw event. This is demonstrated in the demos.
* A few of the built-in GML variables and functions don't work with this extension.
* You can't create more than one window. I just don't see a purpose for it since 
  this is for game dev and not software dev. It could be added in the future though.
* If you're going to take a look at the C++ source code, I'm sorry. I'm inexperienced
  and probably have a ton of amateur mistakes riddled throughout the project. I'm open
  to advice though.
* It says for Gamemaker Studio 2 because I'm creating the extension in Gamemaker Studio 2.
  I don't see why you couldn't use this in Gamemaker Studio 1.4.9999, but you'll have to set up
  the extension yourself. I won't be making one. You have to move on guys. ;)
